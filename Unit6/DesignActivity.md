| Scenario  | A description of a set of interactions and/or tasks that describe a start-to-finish example of how a user might want to use the application |
| Wireframe | A high-level sketch of an application's user interface intended to  help visualize layout, interactions, and transitions |

## Pitch

In one paragraph or less, what does this thing do? What's it good for?

## Define

List the features and use case scenarios.

### Features

What can this app do?

1. Enter short blobs of text
2. See a history of the blobs of text
3. What else ... ? Discuss as a class.

### Use Case Scenarios

How will uses use the app? Try to tell a story about each use case.

Marnee wants to tell the world about her love of programming. She enters a message in the app and others can see it.

What else ... ? Discuss as a class.

### Sketch

Draw out what it would look like.

* Make wireframes
* Whiteboarding

## Expand

Use the Final Project Plan Organizer to build a specification.

You want as much detail as possible. We want as complete a picture of what we are building as possible.

Using the whiteboards, let's walk through how you would do the Project Plan Organizer.

> This is something we always do before every project in most software organization. 

> "Failing to plan is planning to fail."

# Debrief

Have the students create all of the planning documents.

Have them prioritize features and figure out what tasks to do first.

## Question to ask yourself

>"What is the most important code I need to write to make this all work."

>"What functionality might be used in multiple places"

## Figuring out dependencies.

BEFORE YOU GET STARTED

>Think:
"I cant work on X until Y is done"

### Continually update your specification and project plan

Your specification and your project plan are not set in stone. As you start working you will find that you may need to make significant changes to your original design. Thank is Ok! and totally normal. But you will need to update your original documents, or re-write them. You will be expected to produce a spec and plan that fits your final project.
