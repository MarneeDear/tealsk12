# Build custom blocks in SNAP!

Custom blocks are code scripts that you can re-use and look like a code block. In order to use them well you will need to apply abstraction, generalization, detail removal, procedural decomposition. They can be harder to use, but they will make your code simpler and easier to troubleshoot as you can drop them anywhere and try using them in different ways.

## Example blocks

I need to toggle the color of a block based on input from the user.
