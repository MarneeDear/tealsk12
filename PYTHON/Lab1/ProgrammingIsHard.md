# Programming is hard!

We all struggle. Even expeienced, paid, professional Software Engineers struggle. I struggle every day. My coworkers struggle every day. 

I teach Grad Students how to program. They have all the same challenges, make all the same mistakes. It's OK! It's normal.

I failed my first programming class. I had to get my dad to help me just figure out the basic things. It was hard. I was really down on myself. I thought I was just not cut out for it. But I didn't give up. I put those thoughts aside. And the next class I took I Aced it. I buckled down hard and made it happen. 

## YOU CAN DO IT

## The pit of despair

It happens so often it has its own meme!

## Attitude is everything

If you aren't in the right mindset, programming is really hard. That's ok. We all have bad days. We have bad weeks, and we even have bad months! I have been having one myself. You can ask my coworkers!

But there are things you can do to help yourself.

Tell yourself it's ok! Look back at previous labs to remember what you have done. Look at your Python cheat sheet.

Breakdown your problem into smaller bits that you can easily reason about. Do that bit. Then do that again. Before you know it, you will have a program.

## Comments first

We haven't covered comments, but this is a trick all of us programmers use.

Before you write any code, write out what you think you could do in comments like this:

```python

# define a list that represents the positions on the tic tac grid

# get input from user

# use input to find that position on the grid

# print out the result to see what happened, or see if my hypothesis was correct

```
