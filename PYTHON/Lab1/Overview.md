# Overview of Lesson 1

# Using the interactive command line (REPL)

Read
Eval
Print
Loop

Use the REPL to execute lines of code one at a time.

Can also be used to execute entire files.

* Type
* Operators
* Expressions
* Statement
* Variable

# Value

1

"Hello World"

'a', 'b'

# Type

## String

Strings are like a list of characters. Strings are the type you use to identify words and phrases.

"Hello World" is a string which is considered a list of characters that combine to make a whole string.

## Numbers
* Integers (whole numbers)
    * 1, 2, 3, 4
* Float (decimals)
    * 1.1, 3.14, 1000.5454

## Operators

Operators are symbols that represent computations.

These symbols will do things to the VALUES you pass to them. For example, we can use operators to to math.

* ADD with +
* SUBTRACT with -
* DIVIDE with / or //
* MULTIPLY with *

## Expressions
Expressions are a combination of values and operators to get something back, a result.

For example, we can do some addition:

`2 + 3` is an expression that adds 2 and 3 together and the result is 5.

## Statement
Statements are the smallest units of code that can be executed.

For example, we can tell Python to display something with the `print` statement like this:

print("Hello World!")

## Variables

Variables are names that refer to values. They can hold a value and the value can be changed.

For example:

peaches = "strawberries"

print(peaches)

The result of this would be:

"strawberries"

>> Pro tip: new programmers often get strings and variable names mixed up. Variables can hold any value like a string or a number, but a string is always denoted in the code with quotes around it.

"strawberries" is the value

`peaches` is the variable name

Do Lab 1 Section 1 now and we will discuss.

# Lab 01

## Operators

`/`/ vs. `//`

## Key Terms

* Floats
* Integers

Do Lab 1 Section 2 now and we will discuss

## Key Terms

    Strings

    What happened when you typed in a?

    What does the error message mean?

Do Lab 1 Section 3 now and we will discus

    What was the difference between the two inputs?​

    Strings can be combined using +.​

    What do you think the error message means?​

    You can’t combine different types!​

    Now, work through section 4​

Do Lab 1 Section 4

    What error did you get? ​

    What do you think that means?​

    What happens when you multiply strings?​

# Part 2

    Define expression: a combination of values and operators (and variables)​

    In your notebook,​

    Give an example of an expression​

    Write down their predictions before going to the interpreter/IDE to check the actual output.​

## Debrief

    In your notebook,​

    Write down what you remember about Order of Operations you learned in math class​

    Show a volunteer or teacher on your way out of class.​
