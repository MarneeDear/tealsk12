# LOOPS!

## While Loops

While loops let you do the same thing over and over again until a condition is met.

To use while loops you need to understand:

### Conditionals!

```python
while True:
    # do a thing
    print('IM IN A LOOP')
```

> Pro tip: to get out of a loop, click in the console and type CTL + C on Windows. Help Marnee out. What would it be on a Mac?

```python
a = 0
while a < 10:
    print(a)
    a += 1 # a = a + 1
```    

### Infinite loops

Happen. You can stop them with good conditions in your while loops.

Take your time and think it through. Loops can be a challenge to reason about.
