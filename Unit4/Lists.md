# Lists

We use lists all the time. We have lists in our heads like:

* Our favorites movies
* Our favorite foods
* Our closest friends

We also have lists we can use to accomplish a task. For example, a grocery lists helps us make sure we get what we need at the store:

1. Milk
2. Cheese
3. Eggs
4. Chicken
5. Tomatoes
6. Cucumbers

In real life, people use checklists to make sure they do everything right every time. For example, a pilot's checklist before takeoff or before landing.

```

Before-Landing Checklist

In more abstract terms, we can think of lists as a collection of items, that may or may not be ordered, that all relate to each other in some way (the reason for having the list).

In programming, we often have a collection of things we need to work with in some way. 

Sometimes we call them `collections` and sometimes we call them `lists`, but the essence is the same.

## Examples

With a `list of numbers` I can:

* Find the item with the highest/lowest value
* Sum all numbers into a total
* Sort the list from highest to lowest or lowest to highest.

With a list of `things` I can:

> In some video games, you can collect items and use them in the game. Those items are stored in a list.

* Find a thing in a list and use it or operate on it.

With a list of `actions` I can do each action in order:

* Move 10 steps
* Turn 90 degrees
* Glide to nearest edge and bounce

With a list of conditions and actions I can compare against the current state and do the relevant action.

> sometimes called a state engine

* When X is 15, then glide 37 steps 90 degree from current location

## Say every letter in a word

In many programming language a word, also known as a string, is considered a list of characters. For example:

"Hello, World!" is actually a list that looks like this:

H -> e -> l -> l -> 0 -> , -> W -> o -> r -> l -> d -> !

The computer considers Hello, World! to be a list of characters where each character points to the next one in the sequence.

## Terms to know

| Word | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Programming List | Called an 'array' in most programming languages, this holds lots of values.|
| Lists Block | A block which controls a list. |
| Operator Block | A block that performs math functions and string handling. |
| List Element | A part of a list. |
| Traverse | Go through or travel across an item/list. |
| Transform | Create a new list based on the values of the old list. |
| Sequential Search Algorithm | A method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
| Index Variable | Keeps track of where you currently are in a list. |
| Join Block | Links two values together and reports the result. |
| Contains Block | Checks an operator block for a particular variable. |

## Lists in Scratch!

> But Scratch’s lists are not first class.  You create one using the “Make a list” button, which requires that you give the list a name.  You can’t put the list into a variable, into an input slot of a block, or into a list item—you can’t have lists of lists.  None of the Scratch reporters reports a list value.(You can use a reduction of the list into a text string as input to other blocks, but this loses the list structure; the input is just a text string, not a data aggregate.)
